## Plant Disease Detection Model with Inceptionv3 Architecture for Object Recognition of Disease Plant

Inception-v3 is a convolutional neural network that is 48 layers deep with Inception block.

## Steps

1) Train the model (pd.ipynb) using Colaboratory which offers Free Gpu for Training.
2) save the model with .h5 extension

## Run
1) Install the required Packages
                      
             pip install -r requirements.txt

2) change Host IP address in app.py file

3) Run python file                    
             
             python app.py
